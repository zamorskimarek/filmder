Answer:

Usage of context provider to decouple data fetching from presentation layer:
Yes, using context provider is a good way to decouple data fetching from presentation layer. With context provider, you can define a separate data layer that can be accessed by any component in your application, without having to pass props down the component tree. This way, you can easily separate the concerns of data fetching and data presentation. You can define a context provider that fetches data from the backend API and provides it to the child components via the context API. The child components can then consume the data and display it as required.

How to test the logic for data fetching:
To test the logic for data fetching, you can use Jest and react-testing-library. You can write unit tests for your data fetching logic to ensure that it is working correctly. One way to test data fetching is to use Jest's mock functions to simulate API requests and responses. You can use the "mockImplementation" method to define a custom response for the API call. You can then use react-testing-library's "waitFor" method to wait for the response to arrive and check if the component is rendering the data correctly.

Here's an example test case for testing the data fetching logic using Jest and react-testing-library:

javascript
Copy code
import React from 'react';
import { render, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import Recommendations from './Recommendations';

jest.mock('./api', () => ({
  getRecommendations: jest.fn(),
}));

describe('Recommendations component', () => {
  it('renders recommendations data', async () => {
    const recommendations = [
      {
        id: '1and3011',
        imageURL: 'https://example.com/image1.jpg',
        title: 'Movie 1',
        summary: 'Summary 1',
        rating: 5.3,
      },
      {
        id: '2301abc',
        imageURL: 'https://example.com/image2.jpg',
        title: 'Movie 2',
        summary: 'Summary 2',
        rating: 8.2,
      },
    ];

    const { getByText, getByAltText } = render(<Recommendations />);

    // Mock the API response
    const { getRecommendations } = require('./api');
    getRecommendations.mockResolvedValue(recommendations);

    // Wait for the recommendations to be loaded
    await waitFor(() => expect(getRecommendations).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1));

    // Check that the recommendations are displayed correctly
    expect(getByAltText('Movie 1')).toHaveAttribute(
      'src',
      'https://example.com/image1.jpg'
    );
    expect(getByText('Movie 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(getByText('Summary 1')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(getByText('5.3')).toBeInTheDocument();

    expect(getByAltText('Movie 2')).toHaveAttribute(
      'src',
      'https://example.com/image2.jpg'
    );
    expect(getByText('Movie 2')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(getByText('Summary 2')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(getByText('8.2')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
In this test case, we're rendering the Recommendations component and mocking the API call to return a list of recommendations. We're using the waitFor method to wait for the API call to complete and then checking that the component is rendering the recommendations data correctly.
